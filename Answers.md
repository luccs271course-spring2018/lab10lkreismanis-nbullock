- There was no difference between BreadthFirstIterator and ClosestFirstIterator. 
- RandomWalkIterator printed randomly.
- The starting point does make a difference.


### 2.) Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.
- A real-world map might require more than four colors if there are multiple disconnected regions, such as islands, more colors would be needed.  
- An additional example is if the map uses a color key to mark certain regions or areas.
